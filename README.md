# Password-Manager

An application that saves website's credentials,

generate passwords and add it to our database of passwords,

but also able to search through that database.

So when you type in the name of a website, hit search,

and it'll tell you what the email and password is, 

that you need to use to log onto

that website. Plus,

this is a lot safer by handling some of the exceptions that

could happen and make sure it works that in all circumstances.
